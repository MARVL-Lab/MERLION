Apologia for manual labeling

the reasoning is, the original labeler labels still have many inconsistencies and glaring flaws, such as atlantic blue tang during the open blue sea episode 4423 4466, named as Dark blue lined fish in 4261-4303, completely incontinuous and incongrous during the episodes 4423 4466 (missing or named as another fish).

during the squid episode as well (named Random white fish) in 5540-6495, it can be seen that the same fish name is spotted in 8966-9049 and 9207-9224, and it is extremely hard to understand why that observation is made during the later episodes. Nothing resembled the squid nor any white fish at all during those episodes

these two fish are very important to scoring. in view of that, I made a manual tabulated label file covering all frames of the GoPro video, but only with particular attention to the fish species highlighted in the [version 1] human benchmark summaries and their labels, adding some new fish observations such as Schoolmaster snapper which appears  early on around 1350 and appears much later on such as in 6901, 7675 and 7774. It is also done in an incremental manner, one label by one label covering any range of frame numbers. This way, the labels can be incrementally updated later on should the human benchmark dataset be updated and more fish chosen by them. For now, it is enough to label the fish which prominently appear in the benchmark summaries.

the way I judged in giving overlapping labels was by minimizing overlaps even when there seemed to be some, so that most episodes will have only one major label / label group (e.g. Squid ink; Blue parrot fish + creole wrasse (almost always found together). This is with the assumption that in any given image there is only one major prominent subject, unless the subjects are less important (with respect to the [version 1] human benchmark)
